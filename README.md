# Final-Project
An earth to universe model

Proposal:

  I will make 3 pages each being a model of the cosmos. The smallest will be an earth, sky, sun and moon model. The second being the solar
system, and the third the universe. Each model will be interactive, at least involving a hover for info feature. Possibly including some
other features as well. The navigation page may be included in each and not it's own separate page.

  There are likely several smaller elements about web design I will need to learn, including simplistic animation interaction.
